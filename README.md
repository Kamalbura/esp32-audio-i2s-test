## üì± Alternative Interfaces & Features

### DumbDisplay & Bluetooth Audio Analysis

- **DumbDisplay**: Use the [DumbDisplay app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.astashov.dumbdisplay) with Bluetooth or USB OTG to visualize and analyze audio from your ESP32 mic directly on your phone.  
  The `dd-working.ino` sketch streams audio and provides a touch-friendly UI for mic, record, and playback, including amplification controls.

### üåê Web Interfaces for Mic Testing

- **Simple Web Interface** (`mic-webserver-done-simple.ino`):  
  Displays a live waveform of the microphone input using Chart.js. Great for quick checks and basic visualization.
- **Advanced Web Interface** (`waveform_mic-web-stream.ino`):  
  Shows waveform history, enables live mic playback in your browser, and provides real-time environment classification (Calm, Normal, Noisy).

### üõ†Ô∏è Serial and Python Tools

- **Serial Test (`serial-test.ino`)**:  
  Tests the I2S mic using the Arduino Serial Plotter for quick hardware verification.
- **Audio Visualizer (`audio_visualizer.py` or `serial_audio_analyze.py`)**:  
  Visualizes and analyzes audio from the ESP32 using Python, with environment classification.
- **Audio Playback (`serial_audio_playback.py`)**:  
  Streams high-quality audio from the ESP32 to your PC speakers or headphones.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

1. **ESP32** reads audio from the I2S mic and sends it as 16-bit PCM samples over USB serial, Bluetooth, or WiFi.
2. **Python scripts** on your PC read the serial data, process it, and either:
   - Visualize and analyze the audio (`serial_audio_analyze.py`, `audio_visualizer.py`)
   - Play the audio directly (`serial_audio_playback.py`)
3. **Web interfaces** let you view live waveforms and environment classification in your browser.
4. **DumbDisplay** lets you analyze and control audio wirelessly on your phone.
5. **Noise reduction** and **environment classification** are performed in real time.

## üìù Tips for Beginners

- **Serial Port:** Find your ESP32's port using Arduino IDE or Device Manager (Windows) / `ls /dev/tty*` (Linux/Mac).
- **Buffer Size & Baud Rate:** If you hear glitches, try lowering the baud rate or buffer size in the Python scripts.
- **Mic Placement:** Keep the mic away from noise sources for best results.
- **Troubleshooting:** If you get serial errors, make sure no other program is using the port.

---

## üß© Advanced Features

- **Noise Reduction:** DC removal, lowpass filtering, and spectral gating for clean audio.
- **Environment Classification:** Detects if the environment is calm, noisy, or contains speech.
- **Low Latency:** Small buffers for near real-time feedback.
- **Bluetooth/Phone Visualization:** Use DumbDisplay for wireless, touch-friendly audio analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Setup & Pinouts

### Required Hardware

- **ESP32 board** (any dev board with I2S support)
- **I2S microphone** (e.g., INMP441)
- **(Optional) I2S speaker/amplifier** (for loopback/speaker tests)
- **USB cable** (for ESP32-PC connection)
- **Jumper wires** (for connections)
- **Breadboard** (recommended for prototyping)

### INMP441 to ESP32 Pin Mapping

| INMP441 Pin | ESP32 Pin Example | Description         |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| VCC         | 3.3V             | Power (do NOT use 5V) |
| GND         | GND              | Ground              |
| WS (LRCL)   | GPIO 25          | Word Select (L/R Clock) |
| SD          | GPIO 33          | Serial Data (DOUT)  |
| SCK (BCLK)  | GPIO 32          | Bit Clock           |

**Note:**  
- Double-check your ESP32 sketch for the exact pin mapping. Some sketches (like `SpeakerTest.ino` or `serial-test.ino`) may use different pins (see comments in each file).
- Always connect VCC to 3.3V, not 5V, to avoid damaging the mic.
